## üõ†Ô∏è About This Project

TThis project was initially generated using [bolt.new](https://bolt.new), inspired by the EMNLP 2024 paper  
*‚ÄúImproving Argument Effectiveness Across Ideologies using Instruction-tuned Large Language Models‚Äù* by El Baff et al.

While the core structure was AI-assisted, I guided the prompt design, adjusted the flow, and plan to continue developing it manually to explore similar ideas in an interactive form.

I believe tools like this can empower people to express themselves more clearly, especially in educational, debate, or AI-assisted writing contexts.
